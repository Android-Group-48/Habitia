New App Ideas (Caroline):
1. Habit Tracker app
    - Allows users to track daily activities that they want to get into the habit of doing (since it typically takes around 60 days to form a new habit)
    - First allows users to enter habits that they want to track and uses a timer system to ensure that it happens every day
    - If user successfully enters it every day, there will be a graph/calendar page that shows their progress; if they miss a day, the streak will turn gray (or something like that) and they get up to 5 (?) grace days if they accidentally miss tracking one
    - Possible use cases: tracking meds, making bed, washing dishes at end of day, etc.
    
2. College Food Swipes App/ Dining Dollars Calculator
    - Just has a button on the first page that you press each time you swipe into your dining hall
    - Has a graph page with how many times you've swiped, how many swipes you have left, and based on the time/date lets you know if you're on track or if you need to swipe less
    - For dining dollars, you enter how your balance and it notifies you based on the weeks left in the quarter how much you can spend daily to stay on track for the school year
 
3. Plant watering notifications
    - You enter what kind of plant you have and it either webscrapes how many times per week the kind of plant needs to be watered or (if too difficult) the user inputs how often it should be watered
    - The user inputs what time of day they would like to be reminded and the app sends a notification each day that the user should water their plant(s) and which plants need to be watered

4. smth similar for laundry where user inputs how long machine loads are for washer/dryer where they live and the app notifies them when their laundry is done

5. BotherMe
    - App that sends notifications on a set schedule (every hour/ two hours / day / week) until the user does a task they don't want to do through the power of annoyance

Top Three App Ideas:
1. Habit Tracker app
    - Category: Lifestyle
    - Mobile: Mobile is most conducive to the use case of this app, since it would often be used on the go and for frequent but short periods of time
    - Story: Doesn't have a major collaborative aspect to it between different people, with a use case of individual users
    - Market: any student, but the use case can extend to professionals or other people in general (anyone who wants to work toward a life change)
    - Habit: strongly builds towards habits, so along with building the habits the user set out to form they would make a habit out of using the app itself for accountability
    - Scope: The scope is more for individual users than for groups of people at at time, but we could incorporate a synced version for group projects so that everyone receives notifications/contributes to the project every day with everyone able to see other group members' progress and contributions.
2. Stylist

   - Avaliable on both smartphone and web. Valuable to those audienes who love to travel.
   - The App can be scalable and have a huge potential market as people usually travel from one place to another.
   - This app can be addictive to travel lovers due to its easy accessibility.
